Test case 1: The prompt asks for code to turn three brand new esp-wroom-32s into a 3-mic beamforming assembly using MicroPython.
Test case 2: The code should include the usage of both MicroPython (for the ESP32) and normal Python (presumably for the workstation).
Test case 3: Heavy computation is allowed on a 32-core, 128GB RAM, Nvidia 4090 workstation, which implies some computational delegation or division of work.
Test case 4: The code should account for integrating the ESP32 modules into the overall beamforming process.
Test case 5: The beamforming functionality should be implemented, and it must leverage the workstation's power for compute-intensive tasks.
