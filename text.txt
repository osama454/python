Test case 1: Write Python code using Triton that works on a 3D grid with dimensions NxNxN, where N is a multiple of 8.  
Test case 2: Ensure each gridpoint contains a density value.  
Test case 3: Use the distance `ds` to represent the distance between any two adjacent gridpoints.  
Test case 4: Compute `gx`, `gy`, and `gz` for every gridpoint, representing the self-gravitating component of the grid.
